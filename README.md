Hey there! 👋 
I'm Pritesh Gupta,
I'm currently in my 4th semester studying Computer Engineering 💻, 
and I'm incredibly passionate about turning lines of code into real-world magic ✨.

Let's connect and explore the fascinating world of programming together! 🌐 

P.S. - My code might not always be perfect, but hey, I'm still under construction.
